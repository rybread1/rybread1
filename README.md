# Hey, I'm Ryan

Senior Data Scientist / ML Engineer in Minneapolis. I build production ML systems and like finding structure in messy data.

## What I work on

- Automated ML pipelines — retraining, monitoring, deployment
- Graph analytics on large networks (Neo4j, 75M+ nodes)
- Unsupervised learning when labeled data isn't available
- ML infrastructure and platform administration (Linux, MLflow, Jupyter)
- Making technical results useful for non-technical people

## Currently exploring

- Graph neural networks and network embeddings
- LLM tooling and agentic workflows
- Open source ML tooling in Python

## Things I reach for

`Python` `SQL` `XGBoost` `PyTorch` `scikit-learn` `Neo4j` `MLflow` `Pandas` `NumPy` `SHAP` `Optuna` `PostgreSQL` `PyArrow` `GitHub Actions` `pytest` `Streamlit` `Plotly` `Linux/Bash`
